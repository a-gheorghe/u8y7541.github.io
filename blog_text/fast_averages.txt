<h1>Fast Mental Math Averages</h1>

<p>When most people are asked to calculate the average of $\{5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6\}$ in their head, they start doing the long, arduous process of adding and dividing which we are taught in school. It's standard to compute $\frac{5 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6}{7}$, and it will take a minute to get the answer. This can be annoying sometimes, especially in math competitions where time is very important. Fortunately, there is a better way to calculate averages by mental math.</p>

<p>One way to calculate averages fast is to think that each number is a person. All of the same numbers are put on a team. The two teams play tug of war. In the case above, there would be three people on the $5$ team, pulling the rope their way, and 4 people on the $6$ team.</p>

<p>If we attached a sign to the middle of the line, after the two teams pulled, the position of the sign would be <i>the average.</i> Using intuition, because there are four people on the $6$ team and three people on the $5$ team, the average ("sign") should be $\frac{4}{7}$ of the way between 5 and 6. In our heads, we can clearly see that $\frac{4}{7}$ of the way between 5 and 6 is $\boxed{5\frac{4}{7}}$. If you don't believe me, you can check by calculating the traditional method!

<h2>Compacting into a formula</h2>

<p>This method's nice, but it's easier to express it as a formula. After some work, I got:</p>

<p>$$\frac{ab + cd}{a + c} = \frac{a}{a + c} \times (b - d) + d$$</p>

<p>An example use:</p>

<p>$\begin{align}\frac{2 \times 20 + 3 \times 30}{2 + 3} = \frac{2}{2 + 3} \times (20 - 30) + 30
= \frac{2}{5} \times -10 + 30
= -4 + 30
= \boxed{26}\end{align}$</p>

<p>That formula looks ugly, so don't use it. It's easier just to remember the "tug of war" scenario.</p>

<h2>Other methods</h2>

<p>"But isn't there something <i>more</i> faster?" you say. There is one. And that involves using your brain and intuition.</p>

<p>Suppose you need to find the average of $\{5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 10\}$. We could set out using the formula above twice to get the right answer, or we could use some shortcuts. Three fives and three sevens would average out to $6$. The remaining $5$ would average with $11$, producing $8$. So now we need to find the average of $\{6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8\}$. Because there are six $6$s and two $8$s, we can reduce it to three $6$s and one $8$. Then it is even easier to solve, and we can do it with the previous method and obtain $6.25$.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, it's just what you find works for you best. Remember, I found all of these out by myself. It seems easy to me, but some people think what I do is too complicated. Have fun beating your friends at math, and wait for the next post!</p>
